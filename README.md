## Known Limitations and Security Considerations

### Email Spoofing Risks
- No email verification during key generation
- Users can generate keys for any email address without verification
- Multiple key pairs could exist for the same email address
- No way to verify if a public key legitimately belongs to the claimed email address

### Key Management Issues
- No secure key distribution mechanism
- Manual sharing of public keys required
- No central trusted key server
- No way to verify the authenticity of received public keys
- No key revocation system in place

### Missing Security Features
- No Web of Trust implementation
- No Certificate Authority integration
- No email ownership verification
- No mechanism to handle compromised keys
- No revocation list maintenance
- No alerts for compromised or revoked keys

### Multi-Recipient Limitations
- One-to-one encryption only
- No group encryption support
- Twitter's 280 character limit restricts encrypted message length
- Each additional recipient would increase encrypted message size

These limitations are important to consider when using this extension for sensitive communications. Future versions may implement additional security features to address these concerns.
